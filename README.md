#Minesweeper

***
##Introduction  
###The project makes the game *Minesweeper* using Java. It is almost the same as the traditional one except for the UI design and the lack of custom function.  

***
##Game Rule  
- First of all, choose the game level and then start the game.  
- Left-click to open the covered squares.  
- Right-click to put a flag on a covered square or remove the flag from the square. Right-click on an uncovered square to open its surrounding area, if the number of flags around the square is equal to the number on the square.  
- Click the mouse scroll to choose another level during anytime of the game.  
- Left-click on the icon in the middle on the top of the window to restart a game.  
- See the left icon on the top to know the number of left mines, and see the right icon to get the idea of the time used.(The time is counted in seconds.)  
- Win the game if all the non-mine squares are uncovered or mark all the mines with flags.  
- Lose the game if any one of the mines is uncovered.

##Bugs and unfinished functions  
- The window cannot be shown completely when choosing the level of medium and hard. However, it will not influence too much of playing.  
- The function of custom is not finished, which means you cannot choose the *custom* button when choosing the levels.
